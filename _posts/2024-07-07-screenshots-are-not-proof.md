Billions of dollars have been made and lost in recent months based on screenshots of Roaring Kitty's account balances [^1]. These screenshots were widely circulated and discussed, yet they could have easily been doctored.

Creating a fake screenshot is incredibly simple. With a standard web browser, anyone can alter numbers and names to present false information. Below, I show how easily anyone can spoof a financial account to display an absurdly large balance (or anything else they please).

While screenshots can be a useful tool for quickly conveying information, they should never be considered irrefutable proof. Far from it, they mean just about nothing.
