I was looking for chainsaws recently and noticed a somewhat consistent pattern: larger chainsaws tend to get worse reviews than the lowest-end models within the same brand and line. Maybe users have higher expectations for larger chainsaws because the spent more money. Alternatively maybe the users who buy larger chainsaws have different baseline propensities to give certain ratings compared to other users; for example, maybe these users are more likely to be profesional arborists and loggers.
