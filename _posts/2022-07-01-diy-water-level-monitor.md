We recently moved into a rural home running on well water. The well pumps groundwater into a storage tank, which holds about 5,000 gallons of water. However, due in large part to the historic [drought](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) in California our well runs dry sometimes and we need to get water delivered when our tank runs low. In order to know when to order our next truckload of water I build a water level monitor that estimates water levels in our storage tank via a 4-20mA pressure sensor loop, processes the data on an Arduino nano board, and streams the data to a server for storage and monitoring using the MQTT messaging protocol.

Why make and not buy? To start with, there really seems to be only one mature [product](https://smartwateronline.com/products/starter-packs/desk-mount-starter-pack) on the market and it costs $599 NZD and ships from New Zealand. Obviously it would have saved me a lot of time to just buy this product but I wanted to save some money and learn a bunch of things while doing so. I also got some help from my dad, who is an electrical engineer, and it was nice to spend that time with him.

## System design
I went through several iterations of this project due to a combination of faulty hardware software dependency issues. I'll spare (most of) the details of the initial versions but suffice it to say there was a lot of trial and error and some returns made. The final product comprises several physical components:
1. 4-20mA sensor converts pressure to resistance, with 0 meters of water resulting in 4mA and 5 meters resulting in 20mA (powered by an 12-32v DC power supply)
1. 180 Ohms resistor converts resistance to analog voltage, ranging from 0.72v (4mA * 180 ohms) to 3.6v (20mA * 180 ohms)
1. Arduino nano 33 IOT board reads analog voltage and calculates water level (powered by a 5v DC power supply)

The board publishes the estimated water level over WiFi using the MQTT messaging protocol to a server where the data is stored and processed. I use [io.adafruit.com](https://io.adafruit.com) to subscribe to my MQTT topic and visualize the data, though I had used the AWS IOT service in an earlier version[^1]. I was also able to easily set up email alerts on Adafruit to notify me when my water level drops below a certain point.

The installation was fairly straightforward due to three factors:
1. There happened to already be a 120v power supply and physical enclosure near our water tank
1. My water tank already had a hole drilled in the top through which I ran the sensor wiring
1. There was good WiFi coverage at this physical enclosure

## Final cost of materials
Not including previous, failed versions, the cost of my setup was roughly $90 and this resulted in some extra supplies (e.g., breadboards, jumper wires) left over.

 Item | Cost at time of purchase | Link 
---|---|---
 Arduino Nano 33 IoT | $24.48 | [link](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-iot-with-headers )
 4â€‘20mA Water Level Transducer | $48.14 | [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09B387X8Y)
 Breadboard (6 pk) | $9.99 | [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LFD4LT6)
 Breadboard jumper wires (120 count) | $6.89 | [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD2BWPY)
 *Total* | *$89.50* |

## Potential next steps
In the future I may subscribe to my MQTT topic on my server in order to permanently store the data. This would also enable me to implement anomaly detection and forecasting but right now I feel the development and maintenance of this functionality would complicate my life more than improve it.

The Arduino code I developed for this project is open source and can be found in [this](https://github.com/rtlee9/water_tank_sensor_code) repository.

[^1]: I had initially used the AWS MQTT service, along lambda and DynamoDB data to store the data; separately I wrote a flask [app](https://github.com/rtlee9/water_monitor) to display the data and notify me when the water was low. This worked fine on my initial setup but I eventually switched board architectures (from ESP32 to Arduino Nano 33), wifi libraries, and messaging libraries due to various reliability issues. At that point I was no longer able to authenticate on AWS with my new board, which used a self-signed SSL certificate and this didn't seem to be well-supported on the AWS IOT service.
