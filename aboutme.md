# About the author
I am an insurance professional living and working in New York City. I am a native Californian with an academic background in economics and computer science. Prior to working in the insurance industry, I was a management consultant to financial service companies.

I dream of making life more efficient -- to do more with less is my ambition. I love finding the truth as revealed by numbers, logic and literature. I believe simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, running, skiing, surfing, longboarding, playing video games, playing guitar, playing squash, playing spikeball, programming, woodworking and spending time with family and friends.
