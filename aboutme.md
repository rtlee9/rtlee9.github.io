# About Eight Portions
Eight Portions is a blog about risk, finance, technology and assorted other topics. It seeks to take a data-driven approach to answering key questions about these topics using open-source software and public data where possible.

I'll be using this blog as an opportunity to learn new technical things and to learn new things about the world. Please feel free to leave feedback, and don't hesitate to suggest new topics -- my contact information can be found at the bottom of the page.

> Give a portion to seven, or even to eight,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.
